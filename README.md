# 02 Portfolio Homework - Flexbox, Media Queries, CSS Variables

## Motivation

As an aspiring developer I require a website on which I can showcase my work to show to potential employers.  I am not a very creative/design minded person so I really struggled with the look of the page and how to achieve a slick look. I will need to put more time into this website before it would be employer ready.  

## Features of the Portfolio Page

```
Portfolio Website with About Me section, My Work, and Contact Details
Use of Flexbox layout for the My Work section, as well as Nav and Footer.  
Use of Media Queries to allow for larger screen sizes
Navigation Bar links to the relevant section
Hero application featuring the Code Refactor
Use of CSS variables to show hover over an area
```
